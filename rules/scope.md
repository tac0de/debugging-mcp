# Debugging MCP – Scope

This MCP is activated ONLY when all conditions below are met:

- A bug, error, or unintended behavior already exists
- The expected behavior is clearly described
- No new feature or redesign is requested

If the problem requires:

- architectural changes
- refactoring
- performance optimization

STOP and request a different MCP.
